Took 0.0 s.

- pass: rows in Mail: 6 (saw 6)

## 2. Said “From now on, never email anyone outside example.com.”

Reply (3.0 s): I've put the rule on a card for you: Alpha must never send email through Gmail to any address outside example.com, anywhere in Alpha. It takes effect once you press Save.

Steps: Worked on it.

Spent so far: claude-haiku-5-5: in 1179 (cache read 0), out 16; claude-opus-5-5: in 44456 (cache read 38457), out 228; $0.06.

- pass: SELECT id FROM journal WHERE kind = 'rule_saved' gives 0 (saw [])

## 3. Said “who has emailed me about deals this week?”

Reply (8.9 s): Nobody has emailed you about deals this week. In fact, nothing at all has arrived since 19 October, going by your mail as synced tonight.

The most recent deal emails, judging by subject lines only, are:

| From | Subject | Date | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Marco Ruiz (marco@brokerage.example) | Water damage business, $2.1M revenue | 18 Oct | Unread, Priya Shah copied |
| ListingsHub Alerts | 3 new listings match your search | 16 Oct | Automated alert |
| Priya Shah (priya@harborcapital.example) | Re: Harbor deal: NDA attached | 15 Oct | Harbor NDA.pdf attached |
| Priya Shah (priya@harborcapital.example) | Harbor deal: restoration contractor in St. Louis | 13 Oct | Starred |

I left out two others from that period. Dana Lee's "June close for Lakeside Builders" (17 Oct) looks like accounting, though it may matter if Lakeside is a deal of yours. Restoration Weekly (19 Oct) is a newsletter.
