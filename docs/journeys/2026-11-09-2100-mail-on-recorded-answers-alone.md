Mail lands in a table, a question is answered from it, and a send waits on its card

Fresh tenant, model claude-opus-5-5, on Claude Code, Alpha's prompt alone.

## 1. Connected gmail for owner@example.com, on recorded answers

Took 0.0 s.

- pass: rows in Mail: 6 (saw 6)

## 2. Said “who has emailed me about deals this week?”

Reply (10.3 s): **No one has emailed you about deals this week.** Your kept mail has nothing since 19 October, and a Gmail search from 2 November on found nothing newer. That search did return two October emails, so its date filter isn't fully reliable, but it showed nothing from November.

The most recent deal emails, all from October, judged by subject line only:

| From | Subject | Date | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Marco Ruiz (brokerage) | Water damage business, $2.1M revenue | 18 Oct | Unread, Priya Shah copied |
| ListingsHub Alerts | 3 new listings match your search | 16 Oct | Automated alert |
| Priya Shah (Harbor Capital) | Re: Harbor deal: NDA attached | 15 Oct | Harbor NDA.pdf attached |
| Priya Shah (Harbor Capital) | Harbor deal: restoration contractor in St. Louis | 13 Oct | Starred |

Dana Lee also wrote on 17 October about the June close for Lakeside Builders. I left that out because it looks like accounting, but it may count if Lakeside is one of your deals.

Reply (3.9 s): Your reply has gone to Priya on the Harbor NDA thread, and it's no longer in your Drafts. The NDA itself wasn't attached, so she'll still need the signed copy from you before she sends the CIM.

I kept it general because I don't know what you discussed. It's a new email rather than a reply to his water damage business thread. If you tell me what came up on the call, I can add it.

It's a new email rather than a reply on the Harbor thread. Your earlier reply there already thanked her for the NDA, so this would be a second thank-you.
